# Computer-vision---Creating-a-larger-data-set-from-MNIST-dataset
This project is the first part of a bigger project, done mid-semester, which is part of computer vision course. It consists of making 3 digits images ( 000 -100) from mnist dataset and adding augmentations 
At last i made a second dataset which consists of different shapes such as triangle, Rectangle & circle , that aree in different shapes and sizes and location in the image itself
# Goals of the project 
* Creation of a new larger dataset with augmantation such as Rotation, Blur , Sharpening , Flip 90 -> 270 degrees ,etc.
* Creation of a new data set from scratch with different examples for each class so we can get a better and more generic model that wont overfit the data

# Python libraries used
* PyTorch
* Numpy
* cv2 - open cv
* sklearn
* pandas
